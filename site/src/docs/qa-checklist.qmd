## Home Shell Behavior

- [ ] Home page hides persistent left sidebar and right TOC.
- [ ] Top bar includes brand, search, and `MENU` trigger.
- [ ] MENU drawer opens/closes by button, overlay click, and `Esc`.

## RowLink Interactions

- [ ] Entire row is clickable.
- [ ] Hover treatment remains subtle (light tint or title emphasis only).
- [ ] `:focus-visible` ring is visible and consistent.

## Topic Page Continuity

- [ ] Topic pages retain left sidebar and right TOC layout.
- [ ] TOC is readable and minimal (not heavy boxed chrome).
- [ ] Pagination controls are compact and visually balanced.

## Figure Frame Contract

- [ ] White-background visuals use `::: {.figure-frame} ... :::`.
- [ ] Figure frame shows subtle border and proper responsive scaling.

## Accessibility and Contrast

- [ ] Skip link appears first in keyboard order.
- [ ] Drawer keyboard navigation does not trap focus after close.
- [ ] Body/control contrast meets WCAG AA.

## Regression

- [ ] `quarto render site/src` completes without broken routes.
- [ ] Search remains usable.
- [ ] Topic `topicXX_agent_writeup.pdf` artifacts still sync after render.

## Internal Tracking Policy

- [ ] Operational run logs are updated in `ops/PROJECT_TRACKER.md` (internal).
- [ ] Public QA page remains checklist-only (no sensitive run logs or raw operational traces).
