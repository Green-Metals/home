## Why This Page Exists

This page demonstrates the target reading experience for the knowledge site: strong hierarchy, generous spacing, and fast scanning. It includes typical documentation components so layout and typography can be checked quickly.

### Reading Density

The body column should keep line length within a comfortable range for sustained reading. Paragraph rhythm should be consistent across desktop and mobile, with no sudden jumps in measure or line-height.

## Structured Content Patterns

### Ordered Process

1. Identify the topic scope and decision question.
2. Collect and validate supporting evidence.
3. Distill findings into the writeup and quality notes.

### Unordered Summary

- Keep findings concise and source-backed.
- Use stable naming conventions across topics.
- Maintain one canonical publishable artifact per topic.

### Reference Table

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `topic_id` | Stable topic key | `topic01_copper` |
| `writeup` | Canonical narrative source | `topicXX_agent_writeup.qmd` |
| `working_note` | Operational control file | `topicXX_agent_working_note.md` |

## Callouts

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Use callouts sparingly for material that changes interpretation, priority, or confidence.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Tip"}
Prefer small, repeatable updates over large unmanaged edits.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Warning"}
Do not publish raw licensed source files to public repositories.
:::

## Figure Frame Pattern

Use the `FigureFrame` wrapper for white-background visuals so they do not appear pasted into the page.

::: {.figure-frame}

## Code Blocks

```bash
quarto render site/src
quarto preview site/src
```

```python
def coverage_score(claims: int, anchored: int) -> float:
    if claims == 0:
        return 0.0
    return anchored / claims
```

## Keyboard and TOC Check

Use keyboard navigation to validate:

- `Tab` reaches the skip link first.
- `Tab` can reach sidebar links, search input, menu trigger, and TOC links.
- Focus rings are visible on all interactive controls.

## Responsive Check

Resize to mobile width and verify:

- Sidebar can be toggled without overlap issues.
- Main content remains readable without horizontal scrolling.
- Heading levels and spacing still show clear hierarchy.
