# 00 Overview

This topic covers alumina and aluminium pathways that can strengthen Australia's export position and industrial resilience within a practical 0-10 year horizon.

## Focus Boundaries
- Upstream to midstream chain: bauxite -> alumina -> primary aluminium -> selected downstream products.
- Priority lens: market pull, processing routes, energy and emissions exposure, and strategic market access.
- Exclusions for this pass: exhaustive company profiling and project-level valuation modeling.

## Working Output for This Phase
- Establish evidence-backed framing for `T1` to `T6`.
- Build a traceable source base in `meta/sources.csv` and `meta/evidence_register.csv`.
- Keep `topic03_agent_writeup.qmd` synchronized as the publication-ready synthesis layer.
