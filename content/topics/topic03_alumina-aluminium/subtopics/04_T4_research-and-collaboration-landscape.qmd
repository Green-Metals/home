# 04 T4 Research and Collaboration Landscape

## Baseline Synthesis
This section maps where research depth, pilot capability, and cross-institution collaboration can accelerate credible industrial deployment.

### T4.1 Capability Map
- Australian research groups and infrastructure linked to alumina and aluminium pathways.
- Industry collaborators and translational capacity.
- International counterparts with strategic relevance.

### T4.2 Collaboration Gaps
- Missing capability links between lab, pilot, and commercial scales.
- Areas where standards, testing, or qualification bottlenecks slow adoption.
- Candidate collaboration structures for faster translation.
