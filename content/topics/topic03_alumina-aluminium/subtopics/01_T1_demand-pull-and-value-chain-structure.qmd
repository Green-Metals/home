# 01 T1 Demand Pull and Value-Chain Structure

## Baseline Synthesis
The topic should first separate demand into product classes that matter for export margin and strategic leverage, then map where Australia can defend value capture rather than only volume.

## Scope for First Evidence Pass
- Demand segmentation: alumina, primary metal, and selected fabricated-product pull.
- Geographic pull: domestic, regional Asia-Pacific, and allied-market demand channels.
- Value-chain leverage points: refining, smelting, alloying, and quality-certified supply interfaces.

## Evidence Priorities
- Global and regional demand trajectory by product class.
- Trade concentration and market-access constraints.
- Margin and competitiveness indicators linked to route, energy, and logistics.

## Pass 2 Early Findings (2026-02-15)
- `C-001` (`E-002`): IEA reports global aluminium demand rose by nearly 3% in 2022 and that China accounted for around 60% of global primary aluminium production, indicating a demand-and-supply landscape where concentration risk is structurally important.
- `C-004` (`E-006`): Australian Aluminium Council data indicates a large export orientation (about 90% of alumina and 86% of bauxite production exported), so value-chain strategy is tightly linked to external market conditions and trade access.
- `C-012` (`E-014`): The 2024 Australian Aluminium Council green-metals submission states demand may nearly double by 2050 and argues recycling alone will not remove the need for additional primary aluminium supply.
- `C-013` (`E-015`): The same submission highlights concentration risk in global supply chains and frames Australia as highly export-linked across bauxite, alumina, and aluminium value streams.

## Immediate Implication for Topic03
- The `T1` decision frame should prioritize which product segments and destination markets can tolerate concentration risk, carbon-border exposure, and logistics volatility while still supporting defensible Australian value capture.
- Demand scenarios should explicitly test concentration and trade-exposure stress cases, not only base-case volume growth.
