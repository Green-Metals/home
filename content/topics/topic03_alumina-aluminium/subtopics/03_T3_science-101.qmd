# 03 T3 Science 101

## Baseline Synthesis
The technical primer should explain only the scientific fundamentals that determine pathway feasibility, cost structure, and quality outcomes for alumina and aluminium value chains.

## Scope for First Evidence Pass
- Core chemistry and thermodynamics relevant to refining and smelting.
- Process-property links that influence product quality and downstream applicability.
- Material and impurity considerations that shape process risk.

## Evidence Priorities
- Primary technical references for process fundamentals.
- Parameter ranges that are repeatedly used in pathway comparisons.
- Clear caveats where operating performance is site-specific.

## Pass 2 Early Findings (2026-02-15)
- `C-007` (`E-009`): The CSIRO DMR-3609 review highlights soda and alkalinity management plus handling or immobilization of heavy metals and NORM as central technical-risk constraints in residue-use pathways.
- `C-010` (`E-012`): The report identifies a specific research gap in detailed speciation and physicochemical behavior of metal species and complexes across application conditions.

## Immediate Implication for Topic03
- The `T3` science chapter should explicitly connect residue chemistry (alkali systems, metal speciation, and immobilization behavior) to pathway feasibility claims in `T2` and risk assessments in `T6`.
