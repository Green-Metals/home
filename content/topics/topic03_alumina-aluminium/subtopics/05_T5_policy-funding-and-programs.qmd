# 05 T5 Policy, Funding, and Programs

## Baseline Synthesis
Policy and program analysis should focus on instruments that directly shift project economics, risk allocation, and time-to-deployment.

## Scope for First Evidence Pass
- Australian federal and state instruments relevant to refining and smelting pathways.
- Allied-market policy settings affecting demand access and carbon-linked trade exposure.
- Public funding and co-investment programs that can de-risk first projects.

## Evidence Priorities
- Program design details (eligibility, duration, and capital/revenue support mechanics).
- Commercial implications for project financing and offtake confidence.
- Gaps between announced policy intent and implementable mechanisms.

## Pass 2 Early Findings (2026-02-15)
- `C-005` (`E-007`): Australia's 2024-25 Budget policy package includes a Green Aluminium Production Credit worth 10% of eligible costs over 2028-29 to 2035-36, plus broader support allocations tied to low-carbon aluminium build-out.
- `C-006` (`E-008`): The EU CBAM transitional phase runs until 31 December 2025 and the definitive system starts on 1 January 2026, with aluminium in scope, creating immediate compliance and market-access planning requirements.
- `C-011` (`E-013`): The DMR-3609 synthesis indicates implementation support must include standards development, market-building, risk/liability frameworks, and targeted incentives, not only technology development.
- `C-016` (`E-018`): The AAC submission argues current low-carbon premiums are generally too small and inconsistent to carry transition economics on their own.
- `C-017` (`E-019`): The submission proposes a combined package of production credits, transformational infrastructure and technology funding, and streamlined approvals.
- `C-018` (`E-020`): The submission frames required transition capital as very large and cites an indicative order-of-magnitude investment need for Australia's industry.

## Immediate Implication for Topic03
- The policy chapter should evaluate both domestic incentives and destination-market carbon rules together, because pathway economics and export access are now jointly policy-mediated.
- Policy assessment should include a second lens on implementation architecture: standards, liability treatment, and market-activation mechanisms for residue-linked pathways.
- Policy analysis should separately test whether proposed instruments close competitiveness gaps in the pre-premium market phase before commodity-scale green demand emerges.
