## Scope and Method in the Source
- The source is a literature and patent review, not an operator-level commercial dataset.
- Coverage includes historical context, patent trends, application classes, barriers, value-opportunity framework, and research/support priorities.
- The report explicitly states it does not include non-public industry research.

## Key Extracted Findings
- Historical implementation gap:
  - The report states that significant large-scale utilization remained limited despite decades of research and patenting.
- Scale and management context:
  - Estimated inventory was over 2.7 billion tonnes with growth over 120 million tonnes per year at the time of publication.
  - Management is framed as local (site/regional) rather than a globally uniform implementation problem.
- Core barrier framework:
  - Four recurring barriers are identified: volume, performance, cost, and risk.
  - Risk dimensions include soda/alkalinity, heavy metals, and NORM handling plus liability and social acceptance.
- Value-opportunity framework:
  - Three value opportunities are defined:
    - construction and chemical applications,
    - environmental and agronomic applications,
    - metallurgical applications.
  - Nine KPAs are used as a prioritization map.
- Research-priority package:
  - Speciation and physicochemical behaviour studies for metals and NORM.
  - Storage-cost and liability analysis for current residue management.
  - Geopolymer process development and cost-benefit analysis.
  - Civil-construction substitution studies with regional-synergy assessment.
  - Cost-benefit analysis of major-metal recovery pathways.
  - Refinery-level database of production, storage, and utilization rates.
- Implementation-support package:
  - Technical R&D alone is insufficient.
  - Standards, regulation, market development, risk analysis, and targeted incentives are required.

## Relevance Mapping to Topic03
- `T2 Processing Pathways`:
  - Adds a barrier-based decision frame (volume/performance/cost/risk).
  - Supports explicit treatment of liability and downstream product-risk constraints.
- `T3 Science 101`:
  - Supports impurity/risk-species emphasis (alkali, heavy metals, NORM) as a core technical constraint layer.
- `T5 Policy, Funding, and Programs`:
  - Supports policy design needs beyond technology (standards, incentives, market-enabling instruments).
- `T6 Evidence Quality, Gaps, and Confidence`:
  - Provides structured research-gap and implementation-gap baseline for contradiction and uncertainty handling.

## Limitations and Caution for Current Use
- Temporal limitation:
  - Quantitative inventory and growth values are 2009-era and must be refreshed for current-year decisions.
- Evidence type limitation:
  - This is a synthesis source; claim promotion to high confidence for current strategy requires newer primary datasets and project evidence.
- Practical implication:
  - Use this reference as a high-value framework source and historical benchmark, not as a current-state market dataset.
