# Topic 03 Research Plan (Research Orchestrator)

## Objective and Scope
- Objective: produce a claim-traceable synthesis of alumina and aluminium pathways relevant to Australian export leverage and industrial competitiveness over a 0-10 year horizon.
- Audience: internal project team and decision stakeholders.
- Boundaries: demand pull, pathway competitiveness, science fundamentals, collaboration landscape, and policy/funding conditions aligned to `T1`-`T6`.
- Out-of-scope in this cycle: asset-level financial modeling and full company strategy profiling.

## Method
- Pass 1 (Landscape): shortlist sources, screen relevance, and lock preliminary claim IDs.
- Pass 2 (Primary verification): extract evidence into `meta/evidence_register.csv` with `E-xxx` IDs and verification status.
- Pass 3 (Contradiction and consensus): resolve conflicts, assign final claim confidence, and record residual uncertainty.

## Preliminary Claim Backlog
- `C-001`: Asia-Pacific demand trajectories are a dominant external pull factor for Australian alumina and aluminium strategy.
- `C-002`: Electricity cost and carbon intensity are first-order competitiveness drivers for low-carbon aluminium pathways.
- `C-003`: Processing pathway choices materially shift cost, emissions, and deployment feasibility outcomes.
- `C-004`: Clean-energy reliability and logistics readiness are critical enablers of pathway viability.
- `C-005`: Policy and funding settings materially influence project bankability and execution timing.
- `C-006`: Key evidence gaps remain in downstream-segment demand and medium-term cost assumptions.
- `C-007`: Residue-utilization implementation barriers are structurally dominated by volume, performance, cost, and risk constraints.
- `C-008`: Historical inventory-growth pressure is high, but implementation is constrained by local site and jurisdiction factors.
- `C-009`: A 3-value-opportunity and 9-KPA framework can be used to prioritize residue-use pathways.
- `C-010`: Priority research gaps include speciation, storage economics, geopolymers, high-volume construction pathways, recovery economics, and site-level residue databases.
- `C-011`: Implementation-support requirements extend beyond R&D to standards, liability framing, market development, and targeted incentives.
- `C-012`: Aluminium demand growth to 2050 is expected to remain strong while recycled supply alone is unlikely to satisfy total demand.
- `C-013`: Australian value chains are export-oriented and exposed to concentrated global market structures.
- `C-014`: Reliable firm low-emissions electricity at internationally competitive delivered cost is the key near-term transition bottleneck.
- `C-015`: Several decarbonisation technologies are expected to scale mainly around or after 2030.
- `C-016`: Current green premiums are not yet a sufficient stand-alone transition signal at commodity scale.
- `C-017`: Effective policy packages likely require production credits, transformational funding, and streamlined approvals.
- `C-018`: Indicative transition-capital requirements are large and require explicit financing architecture.

## Pass-by-Pass Deliverables
- Pass 1 deliverables:
  - updated `meta/sources.csv` with screened source statuses;
  - claim-to-subtopic mapping notes in `topic03_agent_working_note.md`.
- Pass 2 deliverables:
  - populated `meta/evidence_register.csv` with primary-source-backed rows;
  - module-level updates in `subtopics/01_*.qmd` and `subtopics/02_*.qmd` first.
- Pass 3 deliverables:
  - contradiction notes and confidence decisions in `subtopics/06_T6_evidence-quality-gaps-and-confidence.qmd`;
  - synchronized synthesis in `topic03_agent_writeup.qmd`.

## Execution Sequence
1. Complete Pass 1 for `C-001` to `C-006`.
2. Execute Pass 2 for `C-001` to `C-003` (priority: `T1` and `T2`).
3. Execute Pass 2 for `C-004` and `C-005` (`T4` and `T5` coverage).
4. Run Pass 3 contradiction and confidence closure across all active claims.
5. Publish synchronized topic writeup and regenerate `topic03_agent_writeup.pdf`.
