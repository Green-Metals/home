# Reference Note: 240712-Aluminium-Response-Green-Metals

## Bibliographic Record
- Title: `240712-Aluminium-Response-Green-Metals`
- Publisher/authoring body: Australian Aluminium Council
- Date: 12 July 2024
- Submission context: DISR consultation on unlocking Australia's green iron, steel, alumina and aluminium opportunity
- File path: `content/topics/topic03_alumina-aluminium/refs-sources/AAC_GREEN_METALS_RESPONSE_2024.pdf`
- Length: 27 pages

## Source Type and Use
- Document type: industry policy submission.
- Best use in Topic03:
  - policy and market-position evidence,
  - implementation constraints and investment framing,
  - stated industry transition priorities.
- Not used as sole source for neutral market truth where independent verification is available.

## Key Incorporated Findings
- Demand and supply framing:
  - Submission states aluminium demand may nearly double by 2050 and recycling alone will not eliminate primary supply growth needs.
- Trade and concentration framing:
  - Submission reports high Australian export orientation and highlights concentrated global production structures.
- Transition bottleneck framing:
  - The dominant enabler is presented as reliable, firm, low-emissions electricity at internationally competitive delivered cost.
  - Transmission and grid delivery pace are presented as practical rate-limiters.
- Technology timing framing:
  - Inert-anode and key alumina-abatement pathways are presented as scaling mostly around or after 2030.
- Policy package framing:
  - Submission requests production credits, transformational infrastructure/technology funding, and streamlined approvals.
- Investment magnitude framing:
  - Submission cites a global aluminium transition investment order and scales an indicative Australian share.

## Limitations and Confidence Caveats
- Advocacy source:
  - This is a stakeholder submission with policy intent; conclusions may emphasize industry-priority perspectives.
- Referenced-data dependency:
  - Several quantitative statements are cited from third-party sources; independent triangulation remains required before high-confidence neutral use.
- Commercial sensitivity:
  - Some market observations (for example premiums) are partly experiential and should be treated as directional unless confirmed with independent transaction data.

## Mapping to Topic03 Sections
- `T1`:
  - demand-growth and concentration-risk framing.
- `T2`:
  - electricity-system and technology-readiness constraints.
- `T5`:
  - policy-design and investment-support instruments.
- `T6`:
  - confidence caveats and verification backlog.
