This writeup is the canonical publishable synthesis for Topic 03 (alumina and aluminium). The current version is a structured baseline for evidence intake, pathway comparison, and policy-facing analysis.

## T1. Demand Pull + Value-Chain Structure
This section frames where demand pull is strongest for alumina and aluminium products that can support sustained Australian value capture.

Early evidence snapshot:
- `C-001` (`E-002`): IEA reports global aluminium demand rose by nearly 3% in 2022 while China accounted for around 60% of global primary production, indicating a structurally concentrated market context.
- `C-004` (`E-006`): Australian industry baseline data indicates strong export orientation (about 90% alumina exports and 86% bauxite exports), tying value capture to external market and logistics conditions.
- `C-012` (`E-014`): A 2024 AAC submission states demand may nearly double by 2050 and argues recycled supply growth alone is insufficient for total demand.
- `C-013` (`E-015`): The same submission highlights concentrated global supply structures and Australia's strong export linkage across the value chain.

Current focus:
- Narrow demand analysis to product segments and destinations where concentration and compliance risks can still support robust Australian margin capture.
- Stress test demand and market-access strategy under concentration and trade-exposure scenarios, not only base-case demand growth.

## T2. Processing Pathways
This section compares technical and commercial pathway options from bauxite through alumina and primary aluminium, with focus on route-dependent cost and emissions outcomes.

Early evidence snapshot:
- `C-002` (`E-003`, `E-004`): IEA and IAI evidence indicates pathway competitiveness is highly sensitive to electricity cost and carbon intensity, with recent global intensity reductions demonstrating progress but not full decarbonization.
- `C-003` (`E-005`): IEA indicates inert anode technology can reduce direct process emissions by around 15% at cell level, but deployment remains conditional on clean-power availability and implementation readiness.
- `C-007` (`E-009`) and `C-008` (`E-010`): The CSIRO DMR-3609 review indicates residue-utilization implementation has historically been constrained by a coupled volume/performance/cost/risk barrier set and requires site-specific deployment logic.
- `C-009` (`E-011`): A 3-value-opportunity and 9-KPA framework is available for structuring residue-use pathway prioritization.
- `C-014` (`E-016`): The AAC submission identifies reliable firm low-emissions electricity at internationally competitive delivered cost as the dominant near-term transition constraint.
- `C-015` (`E-017`): The submission indicates key technology deployment at scale is mainly expected around or after 2030.

Current focus:
- Compare pathway combinations as coupled technology-plus-energy-system choices, not standalone technology selections.
- Apply barrier scoring (volume, performance, cost, risk) and location-specific feasibility tests to each candidate residue-linked pathway.
- Separate pathway scoring into pre-2030 and post-2030 readiness windows.

## T3. Science 101
This section provides the minimum scientific foundation required to interpret pathway claims correctly.

Early evidence snapshot:
- `C-007` (`E-009`): Residue-use technical risk depends strongly on soda/alkalinity control and heavy-metal/NORM handling or immobilization.
- `C-010` (`E-012`): The DMR-3609 research-priority table highlights unresolved speciation and physicochemical-behavior gaps as blockers for scale-up in environmental/agronomic pathways.

Current focus:
- Connect residue chemistry and impurity behavior directly to feasibility claims in `T2` and risk controls in `T6`.

## T4. Research and Collaboration Landscape
This section maps the research and collaboration ecosystem needed to move from technical potential to deployment.

### T4.1 Capability Map
- Identify relevant Australian research and pilot capabilities.
- Map translational partners across industry, labs, and institutions.
- Position international collaborators that can accelerate execution.

### T4.2 Collaboration Gaps
- Highlight missing links between research outputs and commercial adoption.
- Identify testing, standards, or qualification bottlenecks.
- Outline collaboration structures that can reduce deployment friction.

## T5. Policy, Funding, and Programs
This section evaluates policy instruments and funding mechanisms that materially influence project bankability and timing.

Early evidence snapshot:
- `C-005` (`E-007`): Australia's 2024-25 Budget package includes a Green Aluminium Production Credit worth 10% of eligible costs over 2028-29 to 2035-36, plus additional support for Australian-made low-carbon aluminium.
- `C-006` (`E-008`): EU CBAM is in transition until 31 December 2025 and enters definitive operation on 1 January 2026, with aluminium explicitly in scope.
- `C-011` (`E-013`): DMR-3609 indicates implementation support must include standards, market development, liability/risk framing, and targeted incentives in addition to technical R&D.
- `C-016` (`E-018`): AAC argues current low-carbon premiums are generally too small and inconsistent to finance transition at scale.
- `C-017` (`E-019`): AAC proposes production credits plus transformational infrastructure/technology funding and streamlined approvals.
- `C-018` (`E-020`): AAC frames transition-capital requirements as very large, citing an indicative global order-of-magnitude and an implied Australian share.

Current focus:
- Evaluate domestic incentive design and destination-market carbon-border rules as one integrated policy-risk system.
- Include implementation architecture assessment (standards, liability treatment, and adoption incentives) as a co-equal policy lens.
- Test whether proposed instruments close competitiveness gaps before commodity-scale green premiums emerge.

## T6. Evidence Quality, Gaps, and Confidence
This section provides the confidence posture for major claims and records unresolved uncertainty transparently.

Current confidence snapshot:
- `C-001`: `medium` (strong directional evidence on concentration and demand growth; limited product-level demand disaggregation in current pass).
- `C-002`: `high` (direct, convergent evidence on electricity-driven cost and emissions sensitivity).
- `C-003`: `medium` (technology effect supported; commercial roll-out evidence still incomplete).
- `C-004`: `medium` (Australia capability/export data is clear; independent government trade triangulation still pending).
- `C-005`: `high` (policy instrument value and timing windows are explicit in primary budget documentation).
- `C-006`: `high` (regulatory timeline and sector scope are explicit in primary EU documentation).
- `C-007`: `medium` (strong historical synthesis support; current implementation status still requires updated validation).
- `C-008`: `medium` (historical inventory and growth values are explicit but time-sensitive and require current refresh).
- `C-009`: `medium` (framework is robust for structuring analysis but not a direct substitute for current techno-economics).
- `C-010`: `high` (research-priority and knowledge-gap mapping is explicit and operationally useful).
- `C-011`: `high` (implementation-support requirements are explicit and policy-relevant).
- `C-012`: `medium` (directionally strong demand framing; requires direct triangulation with source datasets).
- `C-013`: `medium` (concentration framing is plausible but should be cross-checked with independent official statistics).
- `C-014`: `high` (constraint statement is explicit and repeated).
- `C-015`: `medium` (timing is forecast-dependent).
- `C-016`: `medium` (premium framing is informative but partly observational).
- `C-017`: `high` (policy package is explicit).
- `C-018`: `medium` (investment magnitude framing is useful but methodology-sensitive).

Temporal caveat:
- DMR-3609 is a 2009 framework source; its quantitative baseline values are treated as historical unless refreshed by current primary datasets.

Source-positioning caveat:
- The AAC 2024 paper is an industry submission; it is treated as primary evidence for stated constraints and policy asks, with quantitative claims triangulated before high-confidence neutral use.
