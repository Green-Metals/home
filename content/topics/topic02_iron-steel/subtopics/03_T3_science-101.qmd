# 03 T3 Science 101

## Purpose
Provide the minimum technical grounding required to interpret pathway claims in `T2` consistently.

## Baseline Concepts
- Route-level emissions and cost are driven by reduction chemistry, energy vector, and feed quality.
- Metallisation route choice changes downstream process windows, energy demand, and impurity management.
- Process integration quality (energy, heat, and materials loops) strongly influences practical competitiveness.

## Evidence Link
- `C-002` (`E-002`) is the baseline reference for pathway framing and technology transition logic.

## Use Rule
Treat science notes as decision support for pathway screening, not as standalone ranking evidence.
