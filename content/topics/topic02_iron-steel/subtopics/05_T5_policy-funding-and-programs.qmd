# 05 T5 Policy Funding and Programs

## Purpose
Frame policy and finance as execution constraints/enablers rather than background context.

## Evidence Snapshot
- `C-008` (`E-008`): The 2023-2030 strategy explicitly targets resilient supply chains, sovereign processing capability, and enabling infrastructure/services.
- `C-007` (`E-007`): REQ indicates iron ore remains over `25%` of resource and energy export earnings while price softness is expected (`US$93/t` in 2024 to `US$82/t` by 2027), reinforcing the value-lift policy case.
- `C-004` (`E-004`): Infrastructure constraints, especially power cost and reliability, materially shape bankability and route timing.

## Working Policy Lens
- Evaluate whether policy settings close the competitiveness gap for export-facing lower-emissions routes.
- Separate market-access policy effects from domestic production-support effects.
- Keep financing analysis coupled to dependency readiness (power, ports, and input chains).

## Near-Term Documentation Need
Add an explicit policy-instrument matrix (measure, mechanism, time window, route relevance) and link each instrument to pre-2030 versus post-2030 pathway windows.
