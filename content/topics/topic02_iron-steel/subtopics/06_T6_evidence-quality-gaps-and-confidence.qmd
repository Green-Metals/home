# 06 T6 Evidence Quality Gaps and Confidence

## Confidence Posture
- `C-001` to `C-005`: `medium` (directional framing is strong; project-level quantitative pathway economics still limited).
- `C-006` to `C-008`: `high` (chapter-level and table-level quantitative extraction completed and verified).
- `C-009`: `high` (tooling purpose is explicit and directly applicable).
- `C-010`: `high` (self-audit of current evidence depth).

## Key Gaps
- Missing project-level pathway economics for pre-2030 versus post-2030 decisions.
- Missing partner and project inventory sufficient for hub-level execution mapping.
- Missing route-level cost and financing comparators tied to specific Australian hub conditions.

## Next Validation Pass
1. Build first partner archetype shortlist by hub and route family.
2. Add route-level economics for BF-BOF improvement, DRI/HBI-linked pathways, and EAF-linked pathways.
3. Re-rate claims after project-level extraction and contradiction check.
