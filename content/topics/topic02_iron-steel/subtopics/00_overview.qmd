# 00 Overview

- Primary topic ID: `topic02_iron-steel`

This module records the first documented baseline for Topic 02 under the export and leverage screen used by Topic 00.

## Current Status
- Topic structure and render contracts are in place.
- `T1` to `T6` subtopic modules are now populated with baseline synthesis.
- Source corpus and evidence register are initialized:
  - `meta/sources.csv`
  - `meta/evidence_register.csv`

## Baseline Framing
- Scope: mineral-derived iron and steel pathways that can lift Australian export value and strategic leverage.
- Horizon: 0-10 years.
- Decision order: export potential, geopolitical leverage, then readiness/adjacency.

## Next Extraction Priorities
1. Extract chapter-level quantitative baselines from `USGS_MCS_2026.pdf` and `AU_REQ_DEC_2025.pdf`.
2. Add project-location and partner candidates per hub in `T4`.
3. Tighten pathway comparison with pre-2030 vs post-2030 readiness split.
