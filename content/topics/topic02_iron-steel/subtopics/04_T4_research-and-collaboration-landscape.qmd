# 04 T4 Research and Collaboration Landscape

## Purpose
Map the capability and partner architecture needed to move from ranked themes to executable projects.

## Evidence Snapshot
- `C-009` (`E-009`): Geoscience Australia map products support hub-location screening and project-status context.
- `C-010` (`E-010`): Current evidence depth is not yet sufficient for partner-level shortlisting.

## Capability Mapping Directions
- Build hub-by-hub inventory structure for:
  - operators,
  - EPC integrators,
  - technology licensors,
  - offtakers,
  - financiers.
- Start with geographically plausible nodes, then tie to route-specific dependencies from `T2`.

## Gap to Close
Topic02 still needs a structured partner register with source-backed role assignment.
