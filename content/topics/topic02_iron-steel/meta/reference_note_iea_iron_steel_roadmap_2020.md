## Extracted quantitative anchors (line-locator based)

1. Sector scale and energy/emissions burden (`HTML line ~1743, ~1875`)
- The page states iron and steel is responsible for about `8%` of global final energy demand and `7%` of energy-sector CO2 emissions.
- It also reports direct emissions of about `2.6 Gt CO2` annually and notes coal provides around `75%` of steel-sector energy demand.

2. Infrastructure and deployment intensity (`HTML line ~3142, ~3299`)
- Access to low-cost renewable electricity (`USD 20-30/MWh`) is identified as a competitive condition for hydrogen-based DRI pathways.
- The transition case indicates additional electricity demand of `~720 TWh` by 2050 for hydrogen pathway deployment.
- The page states rapid infrastructure deployment is required (including large-scale CCUS and hydrogen support systems).

## Use in Topic02 claims
- Supports `C-002` pathway/dependency framing and `T2` route selection logic.
- Supports replacement evidence for Topic00 `C-016` (power availability and competitiveness dependency).

## Notes
- This source is a localized HTML capture of the IEA roadmap page.
- Line numbers are approximate anchor references in the local file and may shift if file formatting changes.
