This writeup is the canonical publishable synthesis for Topic 02 (iron and steel). The current version is a documented baseline aligned to the export and geopolitical-leverage screen used in Topic 00.

## T1. Demand Pull + Value-Chain Structure
This section frames demand and market structure for export-facing iron and steel pathways.

Evidence snapshot:
- `C-001` (`E-001`): IEA framing indicates demand pressure remains material, with growth shifts concentrated in selected emerging regions.
- `C-006` (`E-006`): USGS MCS 2026 reports 2025 world raw steel output at about `1,900 Mt` (China about `980 Mt`) and provides iron ore baseline context.
- `C-007` (`E-007`): REQ Dec 2025 reports Australia iron ore export earnings moving from `A$116.4b` (2024-25) to `A$107.4b` (2026-27) while volumes trend toward `~1,007 Mt`.
- `C-003` (`E-003`): Topic00 continues to rank green iron as a core export-leverage anchor under this demand profile.

Current focus:
- Keep the demand lens export-first and leverage-aware.
- Revalidate concentration and trade baselines before updating rank decisions.

## T2. Processing Pathways
This section compares route families by buildability, dependency risk, and export relevance over a 0-10 year horizon.

Evidence snapshot:
- `C-002` (`E-002`): IEA roadmap framing treats route transition as central; steel is about `8%` of global final energy demand and `7%` of energy-sector CO2 emissions.
- `C-004` (`E-004`): Power cost and reliability are first-order constraints, with IEA highlighting low-cost clean electricity as critical for hydrogen-linked competitiveness.
- `C-005` (`E-005`): Enabling dependencies remain decisive; IEA transition framing includes around `720 TWh` additional electricity demand by 2050 for hydrogen pathway deployment.

Current focus:
- Apply paired pathway-dependency tests (power, reductants, logistics, qualification).
- Separate pre-2030 and post-2030 readiness windows.

## T3. Science 101
This section sets the minimum technical baseline needed for consistent interpretation of pathway claims.

Early evidence snapshot:
- `C-002` (`E-002`): IEA roadmap framing is used as the baseline source for route-transition logic.

Current focus:
- Link reduction chemistry, feed quality, and process integration assumptions directly to `T2` rankings.

## T4. Research and Collaboration Landscape
This section maps partner and capability requirements for execution.

Early evidence snapshot:
- `C-009` (`E-009`): Geospatial project-mapping assets are useful for hub-level opportunity screening.
- `C-010` (`E-010`): Topic02 is not yet partner-shortlist ready and needs deeper extraction.

Current focus:
- Build hub-by-hub partner archetype inventories and tie them to route families.

## T5. Policy, Funding, and Programs
This section evaluates policy and finance settings that affect pathway bankability and execution timing.

Evidence snapshot:
- `C-008` (`E-008`): The 2023-2030 strategy explicitly prioritizes resilient supply chains, sovereign processing capability, and enabling infrastructure/services.
- `C-007` (`E-007`): REQ market outlook shows iron ore earnings pressure under softer prices, supporting policy focus on value-lift rather than volume-only exposure.
- `C-004` (`E-004`): Infrastructure readiness (especially power and logistics) remains a practical gating condition.

Current focus:
- Build route-linked policy matrix (instrument, mechanism, time window, affected pathway).

## T6. Evidence Quality, Gaps, and Confidence
This section records the current confidence posture and unresolved uncertainties.

Current confidence snapshot:
- `C-001` to `C-005`: `medium` (directional strength is adequate; project-level economics are still thin).
- `C-006` to `C-008`: `high` (quantitative extraction completed with anchored source notes).
- `C-009`: `high` (method applicability is clear and operational).
- `C-010`: `high` (explicit self-audit of evidence maturity).

Current key gaps:
- Project-level route economics for pre-2030 decision use.
- Hub-level partner inventory for execution-ready mapping.
