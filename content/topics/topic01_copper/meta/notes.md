# **Copper Research Landscape and Strategic Alignment**







## **Australia-Based Initiatives and Research Groups**





- **University of Queensland (UQ)** – UQ hosts leading copper metallurgy research spanning pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. UQ’s School of Chemical Engineering has a **Hydrometallurgy Research Group** (led by A/Prof. James Vaughan) which developed a novel energy-efficient process to extract copper from low-grade or problematic concentrates . This technology was spun out via a startup (Banksia Minerals Processing) with support from UQ’s commercial arm and federal critical minerals funding . UQ is also strong in flotation and mineral processing: e.g. Prof. Yongjun Peng’s team received ARC Linkage funding in 2023 to improve copper ore processing by selectively rejecting waste minerals and boosting recovery . On the pyrometallurgy side, UQ’s Pyrometallurgy group (Profs. Evgueni Jak, Peter Hayes) has pioneered high-temperature process models for copper smelting, aiming at productivity and energy efficiency gains . *Industry linkages:* UQ frequently partners with industry via ARC Linkage projects and spin-offs – for example, the new UQ copper process (Banksia) attracted venture capital and **Trailblazer** program grants, targeting cleaner, decarbonised copper refining with *local* manufacturing potential .
- **UNSW Sydney** – UNSW has a broad portfolio in sustainable materials extraction and processing. Its **Institute for Industrial Decarbonisation** emphasizes value-added metals and critical minerals processing with lower emissions  . UNSW’s metallurgical engineering groups work on both *pyrometallurgy* and *hydrometallurgy* for non-ferrous metals, including copper. For instance, the Shen Lab at UNSW leads national programs in “green” steelmaking and **metal recovery from waste**  . UNSW’s **Pyrometallurgy Innovation Centre** (within the School of Materials Science & Engineering) researches efficiency and emissions reduction in smelting of iron, aluminum, and non-ferrous metals  – this likely extends to copper smelting and refining (e.g. work on improved furnace design or sensors for smelters). On the recycling front, UNSW’s **SMaRT Centre** (ARC Laureate Prof. Veena Sahajwalla) is internationally known for “microrecycling” of e-waste. They have developed **micro-furnaces** that recover metals like copper and tin from printed circuit boards, turning electronic waste into value-added copper-based alloys while destroying toxic components . This UNSW approach enables circular economy solutions (even **mobile** microfactories in shipping containers) to safely extract ~130 kg of copper per tonne of discarded phones, among other metals  . *Industry/policy relevance:* UNSW’s efforts align with Australia’s push to **onshore more mineral value-adding** . Their econometric analyses show big economic uplift if Australia refines more metals (copper cathode, etc.) domestically , supporting policy cases for local processing. UNSW also partners with industry through initiatives like the **CRC-P on e-waste recycling** and has an **ARC Transformation Training Centre** focused on recycling critical materials (providing skilled PhDs who work on real-world recycling challenges).
- **Curtin University (WA)** – Curtin is a leader in extractive metallurgy research, particularly for **critical and base metals**. It hosts the new **Critical Minerals, Metals and Materials for the Energy Transition (C3MET)** group led by Prof. Jacques Eksteen, with ~29 academics working on extraction of commodities including *nickel, cobalt, lithium, rare earths* – and by extension, copper and precious metals  . Curtin has gained attention for innovative **hydrometallurgical** research: Prof. Eksteen co-invented a *glycine-based leaching* technology for precious and base metals. In partnership with industry (Mining and Process Solutions, MPS), Curtin demonstrated an **alkaline glycine leach** process that selectively dissolves copper, gold, cobalt, etc. without taking up iron or magnesium, yielding a cleaner downstream solution  . This glycine leaching approach (being commercialized by MPS) was showcased as a finalist in OZ Minerals’ “Ingenious Extraction” challenge for improving copper concentrate processing  . Curtin also recently opened the **Kalgoorlie Metals Research Laboratory** (at its WA School of Mines) as a hub for *carbon-neutral metallurgy*. This lab, led by a Professor of Practice in Pyrometallurgy, houses pilot-scale high-temperature furnaces to simulate complete smelter processes using renewable energy and hydrogen instead of fossil fuels  . The aim is to develop end-to-end *green* production pathways for metals like copper and nickel, training the next generation of metallurgists in decarbonised processing  . *Industry links:* Curtin’s metallurgy programs work closely with companies (especially in WA’s mining sector). The **Kalgoorlie lab** received seed funding internally but is seeking industry partnerships for projects and equipment . Curtin is also core partner (with UQ and JCU) in the national **Resources Technology & Critical Minerals Trailblazer** initiative, which drives academia-industry collaboration and commercialization in mining and processing innovation .
- **South Australian Universities (Adelaide/Flinders)** – Given SA’s copper mining prominence (e.g. Olympic Dam), local research focuses on copper processing challenges like impurity removal and low-grade ores. The **ARC Research Hub for Australian Copper-Uranium** (2015–2020) was led by University of Adelaide and brought together Adelaide, Flinders, UQ, other university partners, industry (BHP, OZ Minerals), and government stakeholders  . This Hub developed new *safe, cost-effective methods to remove non-target elements (especially uranium, other radionuclides)* from copper concentrates . By improving impurity control in smelting, the Hub sought to add value to Australia’s concentrates and reduce export penalties. Flinders University contributed to this Hub with expertise in geometallurgy and bio-hydro metallurgy – for example, researchers like A/Prof. Sarah Harmer investigated biomineralization processes that **naturally upgrade chalcopyrite** (the primary copper ore) via bacteria-assisted supergene enrichment  . That work aimed to replicate and accelerate nature’s ore-upgrading (turning refractory chalcopyrite into more easily leached copper minerals) to economically extract copper from low-grade ores  . *Industry relevance:* These SA initiatives align with industry needs at Olympic Dam and other polymetallic deposits – e.g. developing ways to remove **uranium or arsenic from copper concentrates** to meet smelter requirements . Adelaide’s Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Resources continues related work, and SA hosts the annual **Copper to the World** conference which often highlights such university-industry research. (Notably, in 2025 UQ’s Banksia startup won the “Smarter Copper Processing” prize at Copper to the World, underscoring the cross-pollination between academia and industry in copper innovation .)
- **National Science Agency (CSIRO) and CRCs** – CSIRO’s Mineral Resources division is a key player in Australian copper R&D, often collaborating with universities. CSIRO has capabilities in **leaching technology, heap bioleaching, and processing digital twins**. They were involved in the Kapunda in-situ copper recovery trials (with EnviroCopper) and lead work on *sensor-based ore sorting* and *efficient comminution*, which indirectly benefit copper operations. Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) also support copper-related innovation. For example, the **Heavy Industry Low-Carbon Transition (HILT) CRC** is developing low-CO₂ metal production pathways for steel, alumina, and potentially copper. In 2025, CSIRO and HILT CRC launched a $10 million “Green Metals” initiative to accelerate **zero-emission production** of iron, steel, *and other metals* in Australia  . While HILT’s current focus is on iron/aluminum, the knowledge (renewable-powered furnaces, hydrogen use, etc.) could be extended to copper smelting (e.g. decarbonizing Glencore’s Mount Isa copper smelter, whose future is a national strategic concern ). Another example is the now-concluded **CRC ORE**, which researched optimized extraction – some outcomes (Grade Engineering™ to pre-concentrate ore, coarse waste rejection, etc.) can improve copper mining sustainability by reducing energy per tonne of metal. Looking ahead, the new **Trailblazer Universities Program** (Curtin/UQ-led) and initiatives like the **National Industry PhD** program   provide fresh avenues for an anchor institution to partner across institutions and with industry on copper-focused projects.







## **Global University and Research Institute Activities**





Globally, **copper research is thriving** at top universities and institutes, often driven by the clean energy transition’s demand for copper. A few notable activities and trends:



- **North America:** *Canada* – The University of British Columbia (UBC) is renowned for hydrometallurgy research. UBC hosts an industry-funded **Hydrometallurgy Chair** program, and its researchers (e.g. Prof. Wenying Liu) develop sustainable leaching processes for complex concentrates . In a recent challenge, a UBC team proposed an innovative **ferric chloride leach** for copper-gold concentrates to eliminate waste gypsum formation and avoid cyanide, thereby cutting neutralization and environmental costs  . This reflects a broader push to replace conventional acid-sulfate leaching with cleaner alternatives (acidic *chloride* systems that allow use of saline water and reduce waste) . *USA* – Multiple American universities focus on extractive metallurgy and recycling. For example, **University of Utah** researchers (with DOE funding) have advanced low-cost bio-hydrometallurgical methods to recover copper from electronic waste . Their process leaches PCBs to extract copper and precious metals at low temperature, avoiding the high-energy smelting of e-waste (which burns off plastics) . This approach could boost e-waste recycling rates and cut millions of tons of CO₂ emissions by replacing conventional smelting with cleaner solvent-based recovery . Other U.S. efforts include the **REMADE Institute** (a DOE-supported consortium for circular manufacturing) which funds projects on improving copper scrap recycling and reuse . In academic research, MIT’s Materials Processing group has pioneered direct **electrochemical routes** for copper extraction: they demonstrated molten sulfide electrolysis that produces copper *without* SO₂ emissions (producing elemental sulfur instead) , akin to a “clean smelting” approach. Such work (often in partnership with startups like **Boston Metal**) is at lab scale but holds promise for long-term, carbon-free copper production. Additionally, U.S. universities like Colorado School of Mines and University of Arizona are strong in mining metallurgy research, often working on improving copper heap leaching, solvent extraction, and arsenic removal – especially relevant to industry in the copper-rich US Southwest.
- **Europe:** European research is driven by both industry (e.g. smelter companies in Germany, Finland) and EU policy (circular economy and critical raw materials initiatives). A good example is the EU-funded **MiCCuR project**, a collaboration of universities in Sweden, Germany, Chile, South Africa, and industry partners to enhance **bioleaching of chalcopyrite** (the most abundant yet hard-to-leach copper ore)  . Coordinated by Linnaeus University (Sweden), this project improved the efficiency of biomining by optimizing microbial consortia to extract copper from low-grade chalcopyrite ore, with the goal of pilot-scale demonstrations in bioheap leaching . The motivation is both economic and environmental: unlocking copper from abundant low-grade resources while **reducing the environmental footprint** (bioleaching avoids the high energy usage of smelting and can operate on waste/low-grade ores) . The EU’s Horizon programs and the EIT RawMaterials consortium have also funded research on *urban mining* of copper (e.g. recovery of metals from WEEE and industrial waste) and **innovations in smelting**. For instance, researchers at KU Leuven and other European institutes work on thermodynamic modeling of copper recycling and refining (Prof. Markus Reuter’s group applies circular economy principles to metallurgical process design). In *Germany*, institutes like **TU Bergakademie Freiberg** (partner in MiCCuR) and Fraunhofer ICT/IFAM investigate advanced copper processing (e.g. microwave-assisted smelting, additive manufacturing of copper components). *Finland* (home to Metso Outotec) has strong R&D in copper smelting and solvent extraction – Aalto University has contributed to flash smelting improvements and novel electrolyte treatments. Europe also emphasizes **policy-linked research**: projects under Horizon Europe look at life-cycle impacts of copper (for energy technologies) and ways to reduce dependency on imported copper via recycling. This holistic approach (technology + policy) is exemplified by a study from the University of Oxford’s Smith School, which showed recycling alone can only meet ~50% of 2050 copper demand – underscoring the need for both improved recycling and mining innovation .
- **Latin America & Africa:** As the world’s top copper producer, *Chile* houses significant research activity. Chilean universities (e.g. Universidad de Chile, PUC Chile) and centers like **AMTC** (Advanced Mining Technology Center) work on mineral processing optimization, copper bioleaching, and tailings reprocessing. Notably, PUC Chile participated in the MiCCuR biomining project , bringing local expertise since Chile has longstanding bioleaching operations (e.g. at Escondida and Chuquicamata for secondary sulfides). Chile’s government has also fostered international R&D partnerships (like sponsoring the **Copper to the World** knowledge exchange with Australia). In *South Africa*, the University of Cape Town’s Centre for Minerals Research is known for flotation and concentrate leaching research, and it too joined the MiCCuR consortium  – reflecting South Africa’s interest in biomining for its own low-grade base metal resources. *China*, the largest copper consumer, is investing heavily in copper metallurgical research (though much is within industry and government labs). Chinese institutions (Central South University, Beijing University of Science & Tech, etc.) have developed their own processes – e.g. improved **continuous smelting technologies** and methods to handle high-arsenic concentrates – but these are less openly published. However, global firms (like Jiangxi Copper) often collaborate with Western researchers on topics like flash converting and slag cleaning optimization.
- **International Industry Collaboration:** It’s worth noting the role of **industry-driven innovation challenges** and cross-border consortia in copper research. The OZ Minerals “Ingenious Extraction” challenge in 2022 drew 260 participants worldwide and yielded several novel concepts for cleaner copper extraction  . Finalist teams combined university researchers and companies from Australia, North America, and Europe – illustrating a global innovation ecosystem. Technologies ranged from *electrodialysis metal recovery* to the Curtin/MPS glycine leach, UBC’s chloride leach, and biotech solutions  . Many of these are proceeding to pilot testing with industry support. This trend of open innovation suggests an anchor institution could engage internationally via similar competitions or consortium projects (for example, joining a Horizon Europe consortium on critical materials or partnering with North American labs on DOE-funded projects).







## **Relevant Funding and Support Mechanisms for Copper R&D**





A variety of funding pathways can underwrite university research in copper metallurgy, recycling, and processing innovation:



- **Australian Research Council (ARC) Grants:** The ARC offers **Discovery** grants (for fundamental science) and **Linkage Projects** (for academia-industry collaborative research). ARC Linkage is especially relevant – it has funded multiple copper-related projects (often with industry co-investment). For instance, UQ’s project on sustainable copper smelting models was an ARC Linkage  , and more recently UQ’s Yongjun Peng received Linkage funding to boost copper ore processing efficiency . These grants typically require an industry partner, making them ideal to pursue applied research like novel extraction techniques, recycling processes, or impurity removal in collaboration with mining companies or equipment manufacturers. ARC **Industrial Transformation Research Program** (ITRP) grants are larger-scale opportunities – e.g. the *ARC Research Hub for Copper-Uranium* was funded under this scheme, uniting multiple universities and partners around a five-year program . An anchor institution could target a new ARC Hub or Training Centre focused on, say, “Critical Copper for the Clean Economy,” leveraging the multi-discipline strengths of the university (engineering, science, policy).
- **Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) and Centres of Excellence:** Australia’s CRC program supports long-term industry-linked research centers. While there isn’t a copper-specific CRC currently, related CRCs can fund projects in this domain. The **HILT CRC** (Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition) funds work on low-CO₂ production of metals – proposals for decarbonising copper smelting or electrifying comminution could fit its scope (given HILT’s mandate includes base metals processing) . The **Future Battery Industries CRC** (FBI CRC) focuses on battery value chain; copper is not a battery material per se, but copper recycling could be adjacent to battery recycling efforts (e.g. recovering copper current collectors from spent lithium batteries). An anchor institution could also engage with state-backed centers like the **Minerals Research Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA)**, which co-funds research (including at universities outside WA) on mineral processing innovations – for example, MRIWA has shown interest in zero-emission mining and might support copper-related projects (their Net Zero Emission Mining funds have supported research positions like a Professorship in Pyrometallurgy at Curtin  ).
- **Australian Government Programs:** Recent federal initiatives provide substantial funding for commercializing research in resources. The **Trailblazer Universities Program** (Department of Education) has a dedicated “Resources Technology & Critical Minerals Trailblazer” led by Curtin in partnership with UQ and JCU . This $200+ million program (including industry match) is funding 47 projects to accelerate lab breakthroughs to industry-ready tech . An anchor institution, though not an official lead, can still collaborate or seek sub-project funding via this program, especially if it has technologies ready for scale-up (since Trailblazer supports startups like UQ’s Banksia, which won additional grants through it ). Other federal funding avenues include **ARENA** (Australian Renewable Energy Agency) – while ARENA’s focus is on energy, it has funded projects intersecting with mining, such as renewable-powered comminution or solar thermal for mineral processing. For example, ARENA’s support of *Ultra-Low Cost Solar* and hydrogen could dovetail with research on using solar/hydrogen in copper refining . An anchor institution could pitch copper recycling as an energy-saving measure (recycling copper uses ~85% less energy than primary production ) to bodies like ARENA or the **Climate Solutions Fund**. The **National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)** is less directly relevant, but if there are health-environment aspects (e.g. reducing toxic exposures from e-waste or mine waste), collaborative grants in environmental health could be tapped.
- **International Funding Analogues:** On the global stage, an anchor institution can seek partnerships leveraging overseas funding. The **EU’s Horizon Europe** program regularly calls for projects on raw materials, circular economy, and emissions reduction in industry – providing opportunities to join consortia for funding in the order of €5–10 million per project. For example, Horizon 2020 (the predecessor) funded the biomining project MiCCuR via the ERA-MIN platform  . Horizon Europe is now funding projects on recycling critical metals (copper often included as a target for urban mine recovery), sustainable mining, and material circularity – an anchor institution could be a non-EU partner if it brings unique expertise. In the US, the **Department of Energy (DOE)** funds research through programs like ARPA-E and via its **Critical Materials Institute (CMI)**. While CMI’s focus is on rare earths, the DOE’s Advanced Manufacturing Office and Vehicle Technologies Office have interests in improving efficiency of materials like copper (for motors, wiring etc.). The **REMADE Institute** (a DOE-supported consortium) periodically issues RFPs that international researchers can sometimes collaborate on, especially if there’s a US industry partner; REMADE’s recent calls include topics like “metal recycling process improvements” where copper is a key focus . An anchor institution might also explore the **US National Science Foundation** (NSF) programs for international collaboration or the **US DOE Critical Minerals Funding** (which, after recent policy changes, now considers copper as a mineral of interest due to its importance in electrification). Additionally, institutions like the **World Bank** and **Asia-Pacific Partnership** sometimes fund capacity-building research in mining sustainability that an anchor institution could lead or host.
- **Industry and Philanthropic Funding:** Major mining companies (BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore, Freeport) all have innovation funds or sponsor university research chairs. BHP, for instance, has supported the Olympic Dam-related research hub and invested in startups (they are known to invest in Boston Metal, which works on novel copper extraction). **OEMs and METS companies** (e.g. Metso Outotec, Sandvik, JKTech) also sponsor targeted projects or student scholarships. There are emerging **public-private funds** like the Global Energy Transition fund that might support research into securing copper supply for renewables. An anchor institution can pursue **direct industry sponsorships** for pilot plants or specific research programs (as seen with Curtin’s Kalgoorlie lab seeking industry funds ). Finally, philanthropic or strategic funds (e.g. Ramsay Centre for recycling, or state government innovation funds) might underwrite projects that have regional benefit – for example, Victoria’s government might support a *“circular electronics”* research hub at an anchor institution to reclaim metals (including copper) from local waste streams, tying into both environmental and economic outcomes.







## **Partnership and Pilot Opportunities**





To translate research into impact, an anchor institution should position itself for key partnerships and pilot-scale projects in copper:



- **Join Existing Consortia and Networks:** Plug into national networks like the **Resources Technology & Critical Minerals Trailblazer** – even if an anchor institution is not a lead, it can collaborate on funded projects (e.g. offering an anchor institution’s advanced materials characterization or AI expertise to a Trailblazer copper project). A participating institution could build on prior ARC Copper-Uranium Hub involvement; an anchor institution could co-lead a *new* consortium (ARC or CRC) focused on “Clean Copper for the Energy Transition.” Being proactive in multi-party proposals will open doors to pilot funding and industry access. Additionally, an anchor institution can engage with **AMIRA Global** – this industry collaborative R&D program often runs multi-company projects on mineral processing (an anchor institution could host a project on, say, “Next-Gen Copper Refining” with pooled industry funds). Internationally, an anchor institution could seek partnership in EU Horizon consortia (e.g. if a Horizon Europe call on circular metals arises, an anchor institution could offer to lead a work package on copper recycling, leveraging EU funding and gaining pilot opportunities in Europe).
- **Industry Pilot Programs:** Australia’s copper producers and smelters are logical pilot partners. For example, **BHP/Olympic Dam** – an anchor institution could propose pilot studies on-site (or in lab simulations) to test new impurity removal methods for Olympic Dam’s complex concentrate (building on Hub results to tackle, say, arsenic or chloride issues not fully solved). With **Glencore’s Mt Isa smelter** facing closure pressure , an anchor institution might partner with Glencore and government labs on a pilot to retrofit the smelter for lower emissions or to process different concentrates (keeping sovereign copper refining alive). Similarly, **Newcrest** (now Newmont) has copper-gold operations (e.g. Cadia) with high arsenic concentrates – a pilot on pre-treating such concentrate (perhaps via selective leaching or roasting) could be done with an anchor institution’s input. On the recycling side, partnerships with **state-of-the-art recyclers** are valuable: for instance, **SIMS Metals** or **TES-AMM** (e-waste processor) could host an anchor institution-developed pilot process for urban copper recovery. An anchor institution’s engineering facilities (e.g. in Clayton) could be equipped with semi-continuous pilot rigs for leaching, solvent extraction, or induction furnaces for recycling, which industry partners can utilize for trials. Showcasing pilot results in collaboration with industry will strengthen an anchor institution’s reputation in applied copper research.
- **International Research Partnerships:** Forming alliances with global leaders can yield joint pilot projects. For example, an anchor institution could partner with **UBC** to pilot a novel concentrate leaching process – UBC has laboratory results for chloride leaching of copper-gold concentrates that showed >98% Cu extraction ; an anchor institution could help take this to a larger pilot scale, possibly at a neutral location or through a joint grant. Collaboration with **European institutes** like those in the MiCCuR biomining project could let an anchor institution participate in a bioheap trial either in Australia or Chile (leveraging an anchor institution's microbiology expertise alongside engineering). Another angle is partnering with **technology vendors**: e.g. **Metso Outotec** (Finland) frequently collaborates with academia for pilot testing its new equipment. An anchor institution might host a pilot of a Metso Outotec copper reactor or test a new copper **in-situ recovery** technique in Australia with global input. Additionally, an anchor institution can utilize organizations like the **International Copper Association (ICA)**, which often supports R&D in recycling and efficient usage – ICA could be interested in funding a pilot or demonstrator led by an anchor institution that aligns with global copper industry goals (such as improving end-of-life copper collection).
- **Interdisciplinary and Policy Partnerships:** Given that copper research is not only technical but also socio-economic (supply chains, environmental impact), an anchor institution can partner with government and NGOs on pilot programs that demonstrate policy concepts. For instance, a partnership with the **EPA or state government** to run a **“circular copper” urban mining pilot** in Melbourne – collecting scrap from demolition sites or e-waste and processing it – could serve as a showcase of circular economy in action, with an anchor institution providing technology and analysis. An anchor institution’s strengths in policy (e.g. an anchor institution's sustainability policy institute) could combine with technical pilots to inform new recycling regulations or product stewardship schemes (a pilot take-back and recycling program for appliances to maximize copper recovery, for example). Another partnership avenue is with **electricity network operators or EV manufacturers** on reusing/recycling copper: as the energy transition accelerates, utilities will replace a lot of copper cable and transformers, and EVs will eventually be scrapped – an anchor institution could lead pilot projects on reclaiming and re-purposing this high-quality copper, with industry funding from those sectors.
- **Education/Training Partnerships:** Finally, an anchor institution can align with initiatives that embed students in industry (which often leads to pilot studies). The new **National Industry PhD Program** is one such mechanism  – an anchor institution could place PhD students at a copper mining or smelting company to work on real-world process improvement (with government stipend support). This not only yields research output but strengthens ties with the host company (which might then host pilot experiments or fund equipment). An anchor institution might also partner with TAFE or training providers to develop a specialist training program in copper metallurgy and recycling – meeting the skills gap and simultaneously networking with companies that could sponsor applied research projects or donate pilot plant hardware.







## **Strategic Gaps and Emerging Themes for an anchor institution**





In surveying the landscape, several strategic gaps and emerging research themes stand out – areas where an anchor institution could uniquely contribute and fill voids in copper R&D:



- **Decarbonising Copper Production:** While many groups are working on greener processes, there is a gap in *fully* eliminating carbon emissions from copper smelting/refining. An anchor institution could focus on breakthrough decarbonization technologies – for example, *electrically-driven copper extraction* (building on MIT’s molten sulfide electrolysis concept that produces copper with elemental sulfur, not SO₂ ). By advancing direct electrolysis or hydrogen plasma smelting for copper, an anchor institution can carve a niche in zero-carbon metallurgy. Additionally, an anchor institution’s expertise in electrochemistry and materials could tackle the challenge of **inert anodes** or novel electrolysis cells for copper (analogous to what’s being tried in aluminum). This theme aligns with global climate goals and could attract support from programs targeting industrial decarbonization. The **strategic gap** here is that copper has lagged behind aluminum and steel in decarbonisation efforts – an anchor institution can lead in bringing copper processing into the zero-carbon age.
- **Circular Economy Design and EoL (End-of-Life) Copper Recycling:** Despite progress in e-waste recycling, much copper in society remains unrecovered (in landfills, obsolete infrastructure, etc.). An anchor institution could integrate *design for recycling* into copper-intensive products and innovate in retrieving copper from hard-to-recover sources. One gap is efficient **recycling of copper from complex scrap**: e.g. *mixed metal scrap* (where copper is contaminant in steel or aluminum streams) or *bonded materials* (like copper in motor windings, laminated busbars). Developing solvents, separations or smart disassembly techniques to isolate copper from these could be a focus. An anchor institution’s multi-disciplinary capacity (engineering + IT for robotics + design) can generate systems where products are tagged and disassembled by robots for copper recovery – an area not fully addressed by traditional metallurgy programs. An anchor institution could also champion “urban mining” studies to map and harvest the copper stock in cities (buildings, cables). The emerging theme of *smart circularity* (using digital tracking of materials, AI for scrap sorting) could be an anchor institution’s domain. This not only addresses a gap in practice but speaks to policy on resource security (ensuring a higher recycling rate to reduce the need for new mines ).
- **Impurity Management and Complex Ores:** As high-grade copper ores decline, future sources are increasingly **complex (high impurity)** or combined with other metals. There is a research gap in handling elements like *arsenic, antimony, bismuth, mercury* in copper concentrates – many current smelters struggle with these, and novel pre-processing is needed. Building on the Copper-Uranium Hub’s work (which targeted U/Th in concentrates ), an anchor institution could develop next-generation impurity control techniques. For example, an anchor institution's chemists might design selective chelating agents or ion-exchange resins that remove arsenic from copper leach solutions, or an anchor institution's chemical engineers could optimize roasting conditions to volatilize problematic impurities before smelting (capturing them safely). Another related niche: *Copper from polymetallic ores and tailings* – e.g. recovering copper from tailings of nickel or gold operations, or from copper mine tailings (which may contain unrecovered copper plus cobalt, etc.). An anchor institution could innovate processes to scavenge additional copper (and co-elements) from what is currently waste, turning an environmental liability into a resource. Few institutes focus on this “secondary resource” mining – a gap an anchor institution can fill, possibly with environmental engineering expertise on tailings reprocessing.
- **Integration of Digital Tech in Copper Processing:** An emerging theme is the use of **Industry 4.0 technologies** (AI, sensor networks, digital twins) in mineral processing and refining. While groups like UQ’s JKMRC excel in process modeling, there is opportunity for an anchor institution to lead the *digital transformation* of copper metallurgy. For instance, an anchor institution’s IT and Engineering faculties could collaborate on an AI-driven **smelter control system** that optimizes furnace operation in real-time for energy efficiency and impurity management – bringing advanced control theory and machine learning to an industry that still relies heavily on human operators. Similarly, developing **predictive maintenance algorithms for electrowinning plants** or using big data to predict concentrate blend behavior in smelters are areas largely untapped. An anchor institution’s strength in data science could fill this gap, and industry would welcome improved stability and efficiency. This theme intersects with partnerships (as companies are looking for digital solutions) and could attract funding from schemes like ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centres (for Digital Mines/Minerals).
- **Policy, Sustainability and Lifecycle Analysis:** Another gap is bridging technical research with **policy and lifecycle assessment** specifically for copper. Copper is not on Australia’s “critical minerals” list by rarity, but it is *strategically critical* for clean energy – there is room for an anchor institution to lead in framing copper within the sustainability and policy context. An anchor institution could establish a research program that evaluates scenarios of copper supply and demand under climate targets, building on work like UNSW’s economic modeling . By providing thought leadership on questions like “Can the world meet copper demand responsibly?” or “What policies are needed to promote copper recycling and substitution?”, an anchor institution influences both government and industry strategy. This could involve lifecycle emissions studies of new copper processes vs. old ones, helping to direct R&D to the most impactful areas. It’s an interdisciplinary theme (combining engineering with economics and social science) – a space an anchor institution is well-suited for, given its broad faculties. **Strategically**, this positions an anchor institution as not just responding to trends but guiding them, identifying where Australia (and an anchor institution) should invest effort: for example, highlighting a gap such as the lack of domestic copper refining capacity (if Mt Isa/Townsville close) and proposing solutions (mini-smelters or hydro-refineries) backed by an anchor institution's research.





In summary, an anchor institution can align its copper research strategy with both **national priorities** and **global trends** by focusing on these areas. By leveraging funding mechanisms and forging partnerships, an anchor institution can drive innovation in copper metallurgy (lab-scale experiments through to pilot plants) with an eye on decarbonization, circular economy, and industry impact. This comprehensive approach – spanning fundamental science to policy – will position an anchor institution as a key contributor in the copper research landscape, filling important gaps while creating opportunities for collaboration and funding alignment.
