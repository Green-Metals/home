# 06 T6 Evidence Quality, Gaps, and Confidence

## T6. Evidence Quality, Gaps, and Confidence
### T6.1 Near-term baseline strengthening
The fastest way to strengthen the Australia-first logic is to produce a harmonised baseline package:
- AU value-chain map (mine -> concentrate -> smelt/refine -> semi-fab -> end use -> scrap), including trade-flow pinch points.
- Harmonised baseline table of capacities, flows, and known constraints with evidence keys.
- Maintained collaboration register with lead names, value-chain-stage tagging, and subsidy/funding evidence status for partner triage.
- Expanded Appendix A evidence table for all quantitative claims used in the report narrative.

### T6.2 Pilotable proof points
Near-term work should focus on proof points that are feasible with lab-scale work and limited partner data:
- WP-A1: impurity library and transfer model validated on a representative concentrate suite.
- WP-B1/B2: scrap library pilot and pre-treatment protocol with emissions characterisation for a priority stream.
- WP-B5: comparative TEA/LCA scenario model and measurement protocol for a priority circular route.

### T6.3 Longer-horizon capability build
Longer-term capability is created by maintaining shared datasets and methods:
- impurity library + scrap atlas updated over time
- TEA/LCA and uncertainty templates reusable across projects
- pilot infrastructure pathway aligned to missions (partner-hosted pilots + university bench/pilot assets)

### T6.4 Confidence posture (current)
- `C-001`: medium confidence (directionally supported; harmonized AU capacity/flow table still incomplete).
- `C-002`: medium confidence (route logic supported; AU-specific circular economics still incomplete).
- `C-004`: medium confidence (benchmark architecture signal supported; transferability assumptions still need explicit limits).
- `C-005`: medium confidence (demand pull supported by multiple sources; scenario spread remains material).
- `C-006`: medium confidence (impurity/co-product logic supported; plant-level thresholds remain partner-specific).
- `C-007`: medium confidence (decarbonisation signal supported; scaling assumptions remain highly scenario-sensitive).

### T6.5 Implications and Near-Term Baseline Work
The evidence and logic in this report imply that Australia’s copper research leverage is highest where it reduces risk and uncertainty for a limited set of structurally important nodes (midstream) and where it creates new, defensible capability for complex secondary feeds (circular copper and alloys). The credibility of this strategy depends less on adding more themes and more on quantifying Australia-specific capacities, flows, and constraint envelopes in a harmonised way.

Priority baseline work (to improve the evidence base):
- AU owner/operator mapping and trade-flow quantification (concentrate vs refined vs semi-fab) in one consistent table.
- Plant- and route-relevant constraint envelopes: impurity thresholds, product specs, and environmental performance constraints.
- Australian scrap/e-waste stream characterisation and availability baselines connected to processing rules.
- Comparative TEA/LCA assumptions and measurement protocols suitable for partner use and external scrutiny.
