# Landscape Summary

## 1) Executive Framing and Objective

This landscape scan reframes critical raw materials as **mineral-derived materials and intermediates that can materially improve Australia's export position and geopolitical leverage**, while staying buildable within a 0-10 year horizon.

The portfolio uses a policy-and-industry decision lens:

- Export revenue potential (primary ordering criterion)
- Geopolitical leverage (secondary ordering criterion)
- Readiness and adjacency to existing Australian industry (third ordering criterion)

The output package includes:

- Full 60-topic master taxonomy: `content/topics/topic00_landscape-briefing/meta/crm_topics_master.csv`
- Ranked qualitative tiering (Tier 1 to Tier 3): `content/topics/topic00_landscape-briefing/meta/crm_tier_ranking.csv`
- Top-12 hub and partner archetype mapping: `content/topics/topic00_landscape-briefing/meta/crm_top12_hub_partner_map.csv`
- Evidence register with verification status and confidence: `content/topics/topic00_landscape-briefing/meta/crm_evidence_register.csv`

## 2) Inclusion and Exclusion Logic for Strategic Importance

Included in-scope topics:

- Mineral-derived materials and intermediate processing chains with export value density
- Topics that improve strategic resilience or bargaining power in concentrated global supply chains
- Enablers that unlock multiple anchor export chains
- Byproduct recovery pathways where existing processing streams provide a credible route

De-emphasised or treated as constraints rather than export theses:

- Industrial water and desalination as standalone export themes
- Domestic-first themes without clear export leverage
- Duplicate service categories (consolidated into MRV and market infrastructure categories)

## 3) Consolidated 60-Topic Taxonomy and De-duplication Notes

The portfolio keeps the full A-G structure with de-duplication applied to overlapping service categories.

- A Anchor export plays: 10 topics
- B Strategic components and specialty materials: 12 topics
- C Enabling platforms: 12 topics
- D High-leverage minor metals and byproduct recovery: 13 topics
- E Circular and regional hub plays: 3 topics
- F Qualification-driven battery ecosystem items: 5 topics
- G Hub infrastructure and capability exports: 5 topics

Total: 60 topics.

## 4) Tiering Methodology and Decision Rules

This release uses ranked qualitative tiering only (no numeric aggregate score).

Tier definitions:

- Tier 1: clear export and or leverage upside, credible 0-10 year pathway, strong adjacency
- Tier 2: meaningful potential with material constraints in execution, qualification, feedstock, or policy
- Tier 3: long-cycle, low export leverage fit, or currently constraint-dominated

Ranking method:

- Pairwise precedence first by export potential
- Then geopolitical leverage
- Then readiness and adjacency

Blocker handling:

- Policy-gated items are retained and annotated
- Policy gates can cap rank versus equivalent non-gated peers unless a strategic exception is explicit

Core versus watchlist:

- Flexible by evidence rather than fixed quota
- Current cut: Core includes Tier 1 plus upper Tier 2 where constraints are manageable (ranks 1-32)

### Rationale Patterns Observed

- Tier 1 is dominated by materials that combine export scale with leverage in concentrated supply chains.
- Tier 2 contains high-potential opportunities where qualification, infrastructure, or chemistry complexity is the main limiter.
- Tier 3 includes longer-cycle capability plays, policy-capped options, and constraint-focused enablers.

## 6) Core Portfolio and Watchlist Cut

Current portfolio split:

- Core portfolio: 32 topics (all Tier 1 and upper Tier 2)
- Watchlist: 28 topics (lower Tier 2 and all Tier 3)

Decision logic used in this cut:

- Keep topics in Core where pathways are credible within 0-10 years and dependencies are manageable.
- Move topics to Watchlist where readiness is low, qualification cycles are long, or policy and feedstock constraints dominate.

## 7) Top 12 Hub and Partner Archetype Mapping

Top-12 mapping is provided in `content/topics/topic00_landscape-briefing/meta/crm_top12_hub_partner_map.csv`.

Summary of likely hub concentration:

- Pilbara and Mid West WA: green iron, green chemicals, manganese pathways
- Kwinana and wider WA industrial corridor: lithium chemicals, rare earths, anodes, specialty processing
- Gladstone QLD: aluminium, silicon, chemical feedstocks
- Townsville and North Queensland corridors: copper and selected minor-metals pathways
- Hunter NSW and selected east coast nodes: magnets and advanced manufacturing supply chains

Partner archetypes used:

- Operator
- EPC
- Offtaker
- Technology licensor
- Financier

## 8) Constraint Layer Across the Portfolio

Cross-cutting constraints that materially affect rank outcomes:

- Firmed clean power cost and reliability
- Reagent platform maturity, especially fluorine and phosphate chains
- Port and certified logistics throughput
- Industrial CCS availability for hard-to-abate pathways
- Policy gates for specific chains (for example uranium fuel-cycle services)
- Long qualification timelines in defence and battery subsegments

## 9) Evidence Confidence and Unresolved Uncertainties

Evidence register: `content/topics/topic00_landscape-briefing/meta/crm_evidence_register.csv`

Confidence posture in this release:

- High confidence: portfolio framing, critical-mineral scope anchors, GA map and portal utility
- Medium confidence: ranking order within middle tiers where several pathways are close substitutes
- Lower confidence: long-cycle qualification-heavy battery ecosystem items and exact timing of commercial inflection points

Key unresolved uncertainties:

- Speed of buyer qualification in advanced battery and defence material segments
- Timing and competitiveness of domestic hydrogen-delivered costs
- Actual pace of enabling infrastructure build-out in power, logistics, and CCS

## 10) Next-Pass Work Plan for Quantitative Validation

1. Add quantitative scoring overlays (trade value at risk, concentration risk, capex intensity, qualification time).
2. Convert top-12 mapping into hub-by-hub project pipeline sheets with candidate counterparties.
3. Pull commodity-specific GA and allied datasets for each Top-12 topic and tighten evidence confidence.
4. Add explicit trigger conditions for promoting Watchlist topics into Core.
