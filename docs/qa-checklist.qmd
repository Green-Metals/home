## Layout and Line Length

- [ ] Main paragraph measure stays roughly between `60ch` and `75ch` on desktop.
- [ ] No paragraph line exceeds the readable max width container.
- [ ] H2 and H3 headings are visually distinct by size, spacing, and weight.

## Keyboard and Focus

- [ ] `Tab` order starts at skip link, then header controls, then sidebar, then content.
- [ ] Focus styles are visible with sufficient contrast on links, buttons, and form fields.
- [ ] Sidebar and page TOC can be used without a mouse.

## Color Contrast and Theme

- [ ] Text/background contrast remains readable in both light and dark themes.
- [ ] Theme toggle updates colors without breaking contrast.
- [ ] Active navigation item is clearly indicated in both themes.

## Responsive Behavior

- [ ] Mobile layout avoids horizontal scrolling for body text and tables.
- [ ] Sidebar can be opened/closed at narrow widths.
- [ ] Header controls remain usable and do not overlap.

## Performance and Motion

- [ ] Core reading layout works with JavaScript disabled except search and theme enhancements.
- [ ] Reduced-motion preference disables non-essential transitions.
- [ ] Non-critical visuals are lightweight and lazy-loaded where applicable.
