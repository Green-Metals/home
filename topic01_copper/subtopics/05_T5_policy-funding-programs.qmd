## T5. Policy, Funding, and Programs
### T5.1 Funding and support mechanisms aligned to the analysis
For this analysis, the strongest funding logic is to match project maturity to mechanism design:
- ARC Linkage: partner-coupled applied research where co-investment and direct industry problem statements are required [@arc-2026].
- Trailblazer pathways: commercialization and translation opportunities when technologies need scaling and industry embedding [@edu-2025a; @trailblazer-2023].
- National Industry PhD: workforce-linked projects that embed researchers in operating contexts and generate partner-ready data streams [@edu-2026].
- CRC-linked collaboration: multi-party programs where decarbonization, processing infrastructure, and policy translation need coordinated governance [@csiro-2025; @hiltcrc-2025].

In practical terms, this implies a portfolio architecture where Mission A projects target impurity/operability/decarbonization constraints with midstream partners, and Mission B projects target feed characterization, decontamination, and spec-compliance pathways with recyclers and downstream pull partners.

### T5.2 Implications for analysis scope
The landscape scan strengthens, rather than changes, the core strategy logic. Australia has enough institutional depth to run a copper-focused mission portfolio, but success depends on tighter integration across research groups, pilot hosts, and funding pathways. In this report, the immediate implication is to proceed with a two-mission program and to prioritize projects that can move from lab evidence to pilot protocols in the near term.

Digital process control and sensing remain deferred for this version to keep the report focused on midstream and circular metallurgy deliverables already agreed in scope.
