## Appendix C: Australia Collaboration Register (Operational Artifact)
- File: `topic01_copper/meta/au_copper_value_chain_collaboration_register.csv`
- As-of point: current review cycle snapshot.
- Scope: Australia-local copper value-chain collaborations with named leads, partner institutions, and subsidy/funding signals.
- Stage coverage: mixed coverage across upstream, midstream, and circular stages.  
  Note: some records span two stages; stage assignment uses a primary-stage tagging rule.
- Evidence-status rule:
  - `Directly evidenced`: lead/funding fields are explicit in cited primary sources.
  - `Partially evidenced`: at least one requested field (often project-level funding split or named company research lead) is not explicitly published in cited sources.
