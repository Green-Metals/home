# Project Tracker

Internal operations ledger for tool use, testing, QA, UI checks, deployment notes, decisions, and open issues.
This file is intentionally **not** part of public website rendering.

## 1) Logging Contract
- Log all non-trivial runs that affect structure, content, UI, or deployment.
- Use `date_only` when exact timestamp is unavailable.
- Mark historical rows as `backfilled`.
- Keep one row per meaningful action; avoid duplicates.

| decision_id | date | decision | context | options_considered | chosen_option | consequences | supersedes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D-001 | 2026-02-09 | Topic naming and structure canonicalized | avoid duplicate naming and path drift | ad-hoc naming vs strict contract | `topicXX_agent_working_note.md` + `topicXX_agent_writeup.qmd` + ordered `subtopics/*.qmd` | consistent maintenance and predictable sync | none |
| D-002 | 2026-02-10 | QMD-first publication lane locked | website + citation-ready authoring required | md-first vs qmd-first | qmd-first with PDF outputs | single publishable source and stable render pipeline | prior md-first drafting |
| D-003 | 2026-02-11 | docs IA retained with refined shell | user wanted modern look without losing docs navigation | full marketing shell vs docs shell | docs structure preserved, style modernized | lower IA disruption, faster iteration | early full-shell experiments |
| D-004 | 2026-02-12 | MENU and TOC reliability prioritized over ornamental changes | navigation defects blocked usability | continue styling first vs fix interaction first | interaction reliability first | stable browsing experience | earlier style-heavy pass |
| D-005 | 2026-02-14 | tracking system consolidated | reduce doc bloat while preserving traceability | multi-ledger vs single ledger | single `/ops/PROJECT_TRACKER.md` | simpler maintenance and clearer ownership | split ledger files |
| D-006 | 2026-02-14 | QA artifact policy set to failure-only by default | screenshot evidence growth was disproportionate to value | keep all screenshots vs failure-only default + opt-in full | failure-only default, `SAVE_UI_SMOKE_SCREENSHOTS=1` opt-in full capture | lean ops storage with explicit high-evidence mode available when needed | prior latest-full-set behavior |
| D-007 | 2026-02-14 | Refs corpus checks are CI-structural, not file-presence strict | source corpus files may be intentionally private/untracked | enforce full path existence vs enforce schema + folder contract | enforce schema/path format with refs-folder contract (`.gitkeep`) while allowing missing private corpus files in CI | strict automation without exposing private source files in repo | prior file-presence strictness for refs rows |
| D-008 | 2026-02-14 | Code review is a mandatory workflow gate | reduce regressions while keeping delivery speed | ad-hoc review vs universal heavy review vs risk-based review | risk-based mandatory review with CODEOWNERS + PR checklist + strict checks | better change safety for scripts/CI/UI while keeping content edits fast | informal review-only practice |
| D-009 | 2026-02-14 | Enforce review gate at GitHub branch level | documentation-only policy was insufficiently enforceable | rely on team discipline vs protected branch enforcement | protected `main` with required `quality` check and mandatory review settings | merge safety now enforced by platform controls | unprotected main branch |
| D-010 | 2026-02-14 | Split validation into fast PR gate vs strict main gate | strict-only checks were too slow for iterative PR feedback | keep strict everywhere vs introduce fast-check with safety fallback | fast-check for PR/manual (`check_fast.sh`), strict-check for main publish (`check_all.sh`) | faster iteration without changing release truth gate | strict-only PR workflow |
| D-011 | 2026-02-15 | Standardize Playwright operating mode as CLI-first for manual workflows | mixed usage made closure evidence expectations ambiguous | MCP-first vs scripted-only vs CLI-first with scripted gate truth | CLI-first manual debugging via `./scripts/pw.sh`, scripted `check_ui_smoke.sh` remains release truth, MCP remains exploratory | clearer operator behavior and reproducible debug handoff without changing CI gate architecture | ad-hoc mixed MCP/CLI/manual policy |
| D-012 | 2026-02-15 | Canonicalize source corpus folder naming as `refs-sources/` | workspace migrated topic source-corpus folders from `refs/` to `refs-sources/` | keep mixed naming vs full rename vs rename + checker/docs alignment | use `refs-sources/` as the single canonical contract in docs/checkers/metadata paths | removes path drift and prevents future contract/check mismatch | mixed `refs/` and `refs-sources/` naming |
| D-013 | 2026-02-15 | Source corpus filenames and bibliography keys are standardized on `source_key` | inconsistent corpus filenames and partial bib-key mapping increased drift risk during topic updates | retain human-readable filenames vs deterministic rename+sync routine vs ad-hoc manual edits | deterministic `source_key.ext` filename rule with `@source_key` bibliography coverage via `scripts/sync_sources_and_bib.py` and check-time enforcement | repeatable source intake/update workflow with explicit drift detection in quality gates | ad-hoc filename/bib synchronization workflow |
| D-014 | 2026-02-15 | Multi-agent hierarchy and tracking consolidated with integrator-led ledger | parallel agents required explicit ownership, lease controls, and human/agent doc separation | keep single free-form ledger vs split role files vs embedded role ledger in master tracker | `integrator + domain leads`, lease coordination via `scripts/agent_coord.py`, role activity ledger embedded in `ops/PROJECT_TRACKER.md`, and human/agent docs split | stronger parallel safety with lower file overhead and deterministic closeout checks | D-005 |
| D-015 | 2026-02-15 | Canonical topic HTML route switched to `topicXX_agent_writeup.html` with strict sync enforcement | user requested topic-specific HTML artifacts directly usable in content lane and website routing | keep `WRITEUP.html` route vs dual-name compatibility vs strict cutover to topic-specific route | strict `topicXX_agent_writeup.html` cutover across writeups, site routes, sync pipeline, and checks with `WRITEUP.html` deprecation | deterministic per-topic HTML artifact naming, reduced ambiguity in automation, and explicit drift detection in fast/strict gates | prior `WRITEUP.html` route contract |

| R-005 | 2026-02-15 | release-governance | PR `#1` cannot be merged from current session because GitHub CLI token is invalid and branch protection requires external approval | medium | high | workspace maintainer | run `gh auth login -h github.com`, obtain one PR approval, then merge and verify publish | open | immediate |
| R-006 | 2026-02-15 | release-automation | repo-level GitHub auto-merge is disabled, preventing queued merge completion after checks/review | low | medium | workspace maintainer | enable auto-merge in repo settings if desired; otherwise continue manual PR merge path | open | next governance pass |
| R-007 | 2026-02-15 | permissions | GitHub app integration used by MCP lacks PR review/approval permissions (`Resource not accessible by integration`) | low | high | workspace maintainer | keep MCP for read/status only; perform review/merge via authenticated user `gh` or GitHub UI | open | immediate |
| R-008 | 2026-02-15 | merge-safety | local working tree currently contains a broad mixed change-set unrelated to PR #1 closeout and can contaminate branch-cleanup operations if merged/deleted without intent | medium | high | workspace maintainer | require clean tree gate (`git status` clean) before PR merge/branch-delete; commit or stash intentionally first | open | immediate |
