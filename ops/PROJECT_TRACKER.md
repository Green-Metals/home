# Project Tracker

Internal operations ledger for tool use, testing, QA, UI checks, deployment notes, decisions, and open issues.
This file is intentionally **not** part of public website rendering.

## 1) Logging Contract
- Log all non-trivial runs that affect structure, content, UI, or deployment.
- Use `date_only` when exact timestamp is unavailable.
- Mark historical rows as `backfilled`.
- Keep one row per meaningful action; avoid duplicates.

| D-005 | 2026-02-14 | tracking system consolidated | reduce doc bloat while preserving traceability | multi-ledger vs single ledger | single `/ops/PROJECT_TRACKER.md` | simpler maintenance and clearer ownership | split ledger files |
| D-006 | 2026-02-14 | QA artifact policy set to failure-only by default | screenshot evidence growth was disproportionate to value | keep all screenshots vs failure-only default + opt-in full | failure-only default, `SAVE_UI_SMOKE_SCREENSHOTS=1` opt-in full capture | lean ops storage with explicit high-evidence mode available when needed | prior latest-full-set behavior |
| D-007 | 2026-02-14 | Refs corpus checks are CI-structural, not file-presence strict | source corpus files may be intentionally private/untracked | enforce full path existence vs enforce schema + folder contract | enforce schema/path format with refs-folder contract (`.gitkeep`) while allowing missing private corpus files in CI | strict automation without exposing private source files in repo | prior file-presence strictness for refs rows |

## 4) Open Issues and Risk Register
| issue_id | opened_date | area | description | impact | likelihood | owner | mitigation | status | target_date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-001 | 2026-02-14 | tooling | MCP screenshot capture times out in current environment | low | medium | codex | rely on snapshot + click logs; retry after tooling updates | open | next tooling refresh |
| R-002 | 2026-02-14 | deployment traceability | historical GitHub Actions run IDs not consistently recorded | low | medium | workspace maintainer | mandatory run-id entry for every future deploy action | open | immediate |
